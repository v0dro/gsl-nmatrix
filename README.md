## Description

Ruby/GSL, a ruby interface to GSL (GNU Scientific library) (NMatrix fork).

## Bug Reports

Any bug reports are welcome. If you encounter bugs in Ruby/GSL, please
report them on GitHub: https://github.com/blackwinter/rb-gsl/issues.

## Roadmap

A lot of work still needs to be done to make rb-gsl completely complaint with nmatrix, mainly the fact that we cannot pass nmatrix objects in GSL math methods like Linalg.

These methods will need to be improved to use nmatrix instead of narray.

See the issue tracker for details.
